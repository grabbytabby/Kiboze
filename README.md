Sequence of steps in a geometrical construction for the
large time behavior of a cellular automaton evolving according
to the modulo-two rule 1 SO. The final pattern is the limit of the
sequence shown here. It is a self-similar figure with fractal dimension
log22tp ~ 1. 69 [where tp = (l + V5) /2 is the golden ratio]. An analogous construction for rule 90
